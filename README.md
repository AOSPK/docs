# AOSPK - The Kraken Project
## Official devices application

Submit your request to join the team: https://forms.gle/k967Pzrqd1PBSqQTA

Before you open a pull request to add your device into our list of official devices, you should know a few simple things:

### To turn into a maintainer of Kraken:
1. - You must have a way to check your builds, on your own way, having the device, or send the builds for someone test. Completely blind and/or untested builds aren't allowed.
2. - You must have knowledge of git.
3. - You must do an unofficial build and make the device stable for daily usage before applying.
4. - You should have your device sources open for us take a look.
5. - You mustn't be a placeholder of another maintainer that was removed. The pull request that are considered of that kind won't be accepted.

### Maintainers conduct notes:
1. - The maintainers should upload theirs trees on [AOSPK-Devices](https://github.com/AOSPK-Devices)
2. - The maintainers should test every update before upload in our OTA.
3. - The maintainers must keep the authorship of Git commits on everything that they'll make a change, even it's your device tree, kernel or ROM sources. Lots of git commit --amend and force-pushes are acceptable.
4. - Relationships fights can be done in PM on Telegram or XDA.
5. - The maintainers also need to add **export CUSTOM_BUILD_TYPE=OFFICIAL** in their build environment so OTA app will be included.
6. - You cannot add prebuilts from external apps or piracy

### Upload new buildings:
1. - Make sure the build has been tested and is working. Never do this without the building having been tested!
2. - Official builds must be built from our own server.
3. - In our CI, the builds will be hosted as soon as the maintainer tests. CI automation will also post the build information on official_devices alone.
4. - Only after these steps will you be free to publish in channels, groups and XDA.

### Changelog
Our system is automatic, you should not worry about updating any scripts, just register the new build through our CI, and the Updater will automatically recognize it.

### Over-the-air (OTA) updates
Our system is automatic, you should not worry about updating some script, just upload the new build to the FTP server and send a pull request with the changelog and also edit your device JSON file **builds/device_codename.json**.

Eg: Poco F1 is called **beryllium**, so the device JSON file is **builds/beryllium.json**

**Note:** New builds can take up to 10 minutes to appear on the site and in the OTA application.

**WARNING:** Manual registration is no longer required.
